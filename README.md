# [LibreMesh][5] packages

[![LibreMesh logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/libremesh/lime-web/master/logo/logo.png)](https://libremesh.org)

[LibreMesh project][5] includes the development of several tools used for deploying libre/free mesh networks.

The firmware (the main piece) will allow simple deployment of auto-configurable,
yet versatile, multi-radio mesh networks. Check the [Network Architecture][4] to
see the basic ideas.

We encourage each network community to create its firmware profile on
[network-profiles][10] repository and build the images locally.


## Supported hardware

[In this page][1] we provide a list of requirements that ensure you to have a working LibreMesh node on your router.
This list comes with no warranties: read carefully the [model-specific instructions on OpenWrt wiki][2] and be extra-careful when flashing your routers!


## Building a Firmware Image on Your PC

The LibreMesh firmware can be compiled by following [these instructions][13].


## Testing

LibreMesh has unit tests that help us add new features while keeping maintenance effort contained.

To run the tests simply execute `./run_tests`.

Please read the [[Unit Testing Guide](TESTING.md)] for more details about testing and how to add tests to LibreMesh.

## Virtualization
LibreMesh allows you to test it without having to deal with routers since they can be lifted libremesh instances on virtual machines using QEMU.
Please read [VIRTUALIZING.md] for more details on node virtualization.
